# Automated-SQL-Injection
Modifiable code to perform a basic automated SQL Injection Attack against vulnerable servers.

Tested in WebGoat, a deliberately insecure web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security lessons.

DO NOT USE ON REAL WEBSITES AS THEY WILL NOT BE VULNERABLE TO THIS ATTACK IN ITS CURRENT FORM.
